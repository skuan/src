Garageio with Forms
===================

**Garageio** is a simple Rails app for keeping track of one car collection.

**Garageio with Forms** is a copy of the original app, with a basic Car model and only an index action.

We will create the views and controller actions necessary to allow users to add a new car to their collection. We will also add validations to the form and provide relevant success/error messages to the user.
